# Welcome to Settle the Debt

Last year, we raised nearly $25,000 to help school kids pay down their lunch debt. We started small – paying off 3 schools in Prince William County – and then realized there were so many kids with unpaid lunch debts. Prince William County is amazing, because they give every kid an equal lunch regardless of their ability to pay that day. But at the end of the year, the lunch bills are due and families owing over $50 and unable to pay are sent to collections. Let’s work together to prevent as many families as possible from going to collections. Please help us [pay down this debt!](/donate/)
